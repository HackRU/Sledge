\section{Instructions}

For each hack rate it on a scale from one to five for each of the four
categories: Creativity, Functionality, Technical Difficulty and Design. The
``Total'' column should be the total of the four scores, a number from four to
twenty. For each superlative choose a first and second place. Put a 1 in the box
marking the first place hack for the superlative, and a 2 marking the second
place. Use pencil in case you need to erase. The same hack can win a place for
multiple superlatives, however \textit{ask the team beforehand if they are
running for a superlative, as they are only qualified to win if they nominate
themselves on Devpost.} If a hack doesn't show up, simply write the table number
and a 0 in the Total column.

You will not be judging every table. An organizer should assigned you tables to
judge. You may need multiple of these sheets to judge every hack. Please go
through the tables in the order they were assigned to you. Only one judge should
be at a table at a time, so if you catch up to the next judge either wait or
spend time at the previous table.

\section{Before you hand your judging sheets in...}

First, make sure your name (or the name we know you by) is written somewhere on
each judging sheet. Second, go through all your judging sheets and make sure
between all of them, at most two hacks are ranked for each superlative. Third,
clearly erase or cross out any stray or altered markings so we don't mistake
them with scores. Last, double check that you went to every table you were
assigned.
